Database and Capybara

Project - build a bookmark manager

Capybara
	- We used capybara with cucumber
	- DSL to interact with webpages
		visit
		click on
		fill in
	- flavour of same type of testing but with rspec and capybara
	- if you don't want to interact with customers don't need cucumber!
	- writing tests in rspec with capybara is closer to code so some people read code better than text
	- can then go and translate the rspec steps into cucumber steps for bonus points

Database
	- Store data in a table with rows and columns
	- 


Relational Database
	- stores information about data and how it is related
	- can create relationships between the data

	- Games
		has an ID to recognize a particular game
	- Players
		ID
		name
	- Need a join table: Games Players
		- ID
		- Game-ID
		- Player-ID
	- Every table has an ID

Why we use IDs
	- Database is optimized for speed and storage
		very efficent way of storing data
		easily searchable and indexable
	- Speeds up access to data

Database storage of information
	- CLOB- character large object
	- VARCHAR (255) - variable character length of max 255 characters. more efficient as knows the max length to expect

Mongol - non relationonal database
	uses hashes that are superunique not numbers to store data, prevents ID repetition!

Talking to a database
	always going to be a moment when data gets corrupted and need to connect to database to figure out why the program is not working


SQL
- structured query langauge
- language used to create queries to talk to the database
CRUD
create, read, update, delete


data mapper
	middle man between url and database


qsl
\l 					lists all the databases
\c ddatabase name    connect to a database
\dt					display tables

select * from links;
