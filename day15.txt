London style
	can move far faster in the coding
	think how you want it to be without it being that way
	everything gets wired up in the end

Today's challenge
- code airport control
- lets airplanes land or not land on runways
- allows planes to land and take off
- element of difficulty
- planes can only land or take off if weather is good
- can't land or take off if weather is bad
- need to code random weather
- how do we test a random element? how to test for randomness
- link to a git repo with a skeleton of some specs
     can write far more specs than those!
     skeleton to show you the bare minimum that needs to be tested
