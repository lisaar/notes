self

class C
	def say
		puts "self is #{self}"
	end
end

can then call C.say in irb to find out what self is
	here self is the class C object if you've called C.new.say
		

class Ship
	def initialize(length)
		@length = length
	end
end

submarine = Ship.new(3)

class Submarine < Shiop
	def initialize
		super(3)
	end
end

include ClassName allows a class to inherit from the class


call object.superclass   to know what is the parent class
	object.ancestors

Object.methods.count   

superclass (ancestors) give new objects a default initialize method until you rewrite it

SELF

new is a class method. lives under class. Van doesn't exist until new is called


call this on a class
	def self.large
		new(6)
		
	end
