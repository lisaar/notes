user events in jquery


jQuery('h1')
	grabs the h1 html element or use $

boiler plate code for the basic event handler in index.html
	$(document).ready(function(){

		var p1 = new Player('Alex');
		var p2 - new Player('Lisa');
		var game - new Game(p1, p2);

		jQuery('.choices img').on('click', function(){

			

			p1.picks($(this).data('pick'));
			p2.picks('rock');
		

			$('#result').prepend('<li>' + game.winningMessage() + '</li>');


			$('<li>' + game.winningMessage() + '</li>').prependTo('#results').slideDown();



			$("#results li:gt(4)").fadeOut().remove();

		})
	})
