HTML - structure!!!!!!
- head
- body

<html>
	<head>
		meta information 
			relevant to the particular doc
			nothing to do with the content
			e.g. title of doc, author, keywords, references to things doc needs e.g. javascript and CSS files

		<title>My first website</title>
	</head>

	<body>
		<div>


		</div>

		<span>



		</span>

	</body>
</html>

index.html

in terminal
	open index.html

h1-h6
p
lists -> ul ol
div -> html element with no semantic meaning. block element
	puts text on new line, throws it under
span -> html element with no semantic meaning. not a block
	doesn't break content


previous versions of html didn't have sufficent elements to do the functions of indents and new lines
	div breaks content
	span gives in line


BUT
	HTML should be the structure and not how the document looks like!
	CSS is used to say how document looked


<strong>  are the structural equivalents of <b>
<em>										<i>

	<strong>hello</strong>
	<em>hello</em>

<table>  BEAWARE!

HTML5
	if a browser can't understand an element it treats it as a span/div

HTTP
	fabric of the internet

How does the internet work
	URL
	IP
	DNS
	1. TCP/IP protocol is based on IP and allows two computers to communicate by sending data across a network. (transmission control protocol)
	2. HTTP is build on top of TCP/IP. It uses TCP/IP in order to work.
	3. HTTP hypertext transport protocol
		transport hypertext
		hypertext - is text which is linked with other pieces of text (via hyperlinks)
		helps transport text from one machines to another
	4. http://google.co.uk/images
		URI - uniform resource identifier
			address
				postcode
				door number
		URL uniform resource locator (different to a URI)
			http://google.co.uk/  URL 
				protocol + port number with default :80 + toplevel domain
			images 				  URN
URI is just a name composed of URL and URN

Top level domain  google.co.uk
	points to a (or several) machine(s)
	IP address -> group of  4 numbers seperated from dots 0-255 representing a unique address to a machine
		it identifies a machine
		you can name the IP address using DNS

DNS - domain name system
	asks the IP address of google.co.uk
	keeps asking computers until it finds one that has the IP address
	finds its way to where it needs to go

Once reach the server
	URL helps us to reach the machine
	then program stands at the door of the computer
	there is an implicit :80 -> the default port number for HTTP
	arrived at port :80 and enter the machine
	tells them using http and i want to get the resource with this URN name

TLD finds, connects via port, requests resoure at URN name.
	using HTTP1.1
	machine returns content of website

Machine 1 says GET/HTTP1.1 to  server(machine 2)
	method of HTTP
	post request posts data to server when you login
	browsers only understand get and post methods
	not put, delete, options, head, patch
Machine 2 (server) replies with response
	header - contains info about the request to shw its responding ,time, what kind of server i am, byte length of the body
		status code - tells browser if everything went well or not
			404 error not found
			200 ok (can proceed to body)
			1xx series is informative information
			2xx successful
			3xx	redirections e.g. 304 resource has changed its location, with request to new location to give to browser
			4xx declined errors
			5xx internal server errors
	body - content. the actual HTML -> the visual
		broswer takes string, parses it, interprets it, and displays it in nice way
			parse - resolve
			browser resloves string into a visual

if you know an IP address you don't need a DNS
	can connect direct, don't need address translation
