Security
	- encryption
	- managing access writes
		passwords

Encrypt a password
	- Cesar cipher
	- form of hashing
		string.hash
	- MD5
		bigger pool
		but still can get a hash collision
		can only go one way no way to backtrace
	- generate a salt
		changes the flavour of the password
		salt randomly generates a string
		it is added to the end of the password
		saved in the databse
	password + salt
	- rainbow table
		combination of every single password that's ever been recorded
		5terabytes
		buy every single combination of password, and just loop through
		Block out after 5 attempts
	MD5 very fast but not very secure....

Bcrypt
	better than MD5
	Very slow, 100 times slower
	Becomes not worth it to use a rainbow table as its just too slow
	Incomputationally inefficent to use this, with resources provided


don't ever attempt to write your own password algorigthm

Scrypt


Github uses SHH keys
